# Tabtype

Pathetically simple Swing front-end for JDBC queries.

This follows the "notebook" idea, in which queries and results
are shown in the same buffer.

All of it is sort of hackish and serving an immediate need I have
right now.

See the README [here](src/main/resources) for running instructions.
