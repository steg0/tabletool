# tabletool

Pathetically simple Swing front-end for JDBC queries.

This follows the "notebook" idea, in which queries and results
are shown in the same buffer.

All of it is sort of hackish and serving an immediate need I have
right now.

The working title has been "Myriad", but I am looking for a new
one right now as some other tools have that name too.

See the in-app [README](src/main/resources/README.txt) for running
instructions.
